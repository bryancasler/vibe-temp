At night I would expect the sun vibe and shade vibe temperatures to coincide, but there's always a 1.2 degree difference. Figure out why that is and remove it while still respecting the rest of the algorithm.

The sun vibe and the shade vibe temps on the graph are always 1.2 degrees different. Something about the algorithm has gone wrong because that difference should change throughout the day.
