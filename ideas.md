Prioritization Framework
Prioritize by:
Impact: How much it improves the user experience

User demand: How often users might need it
Technical debt: Whether it fixes existing issues
Which of these resonate most? I can help prioritize based on your goals (e.g., user engagement, mobile usage, sharing, accuracy).
